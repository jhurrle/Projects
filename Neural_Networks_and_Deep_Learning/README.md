## Project Overview

This project was undertaken to gain a deeper understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm specifically designed for processing structured grid data like images. In this project, I developed a model capable of accurately categorizing individuals as either happy or sad based on their facial expressions. All images used for training and testing were sourced from Google via a browser extension. The project showcases the power of CNNs in image classification tasks.
