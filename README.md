Hello, I’m Jorge Lopez Hurrle. I hold a degree in Business Intelligence with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Business Impact. My passion for AI and ML has driven me to continuously seek ways to expand my knowledge and apply my skills in projects that create value for both myself and others. I am confident that my academic background and dedication to continuous learning will allow me to contribute significantly to any team.

This GitHub repository showcases all the projects I’ve worked on, each accompanied by a README file providing detailed explanations. Explore my work and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration!
